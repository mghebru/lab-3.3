What challenges did you face when refactoring your code to use Bootstrap?

One of the main challenges I faced when refactoring my code to use Bootstrap was getting comfortable with utility-first styling concepts, 
especially since this was only my second assignment working with Tailwind. Adjusting to using predefined classes instead of writing custom CSS 
required a shift in how I approached styling and layout decisions. It sometimes took extra time to find the right combination of utility classes
to achieve the desired design, and debugging layout or spacing issues could be challenging. However, this experience was valuable because it gave 
me more hands-on practice and helped me better understand how utility classes work and how to apply them efficiently in future projects.

How did using Bootstrap utility classes and components simplify your styling process?

Using tailwind’s utility classes and pre-built components significantly simplified the styling process. Instead of writing large amounts of custom CSS, 
I was able to apply consistent styling directly within the HTML using utility classes. This reduced the overall size of my CSS file and made the codebase 
easier to read, understand, and maintain. 

In what scenarios might you choose not to use Bootstrap and write custom CSS instead?

I might choose not to use tailwin in scenarios where the design requires highly customized or unique styling that goes beyond what tailwind's 
utility classes easily provide. In projects where a file needs a very specific visual specification or complex animations, writing custom CSS 
can offer more flexibility and control without cluttering the HTML with many utility classes. Custom CSS may also be preferable for smaller 
projects where only minimal styling is needed, or when performance and small code are more imprtant.
